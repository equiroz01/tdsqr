## Notes for Submission

1. **Screenshots:** You'll need screenshots for different device sizes (iPhone 6.7", 6.5", 5.5", iPad Pro 12.9"). Show the main screens: mode selection, TV display mode, control mode, QR creation.

2. **App Icon:** Ensure your icon meets Apple's requirements (1024x1024px, no alpha channel, no rounded corners - Apple adds these automatically).

3. **Bundle ID:** `com.equiroz.tdsqr` (already configured)

4. **Encryption:** Your app.json already declares `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption: false`, which is correct since the app doesn't use encryption beyond standard HTTPS.

5. **Review Notes for Apple:** Consider adding a note explaining the two-device functionality for the App Review team.

**Suggested Review Note:**
```
TDS QR requires two devices to demonstrate full functionality:
1. One device in "TV Mode" to display content
2. Another device in "Control Mode" to manage content

Both devices must be on the same WiFi network. The Control device connects to the TV device by scanning a QR code or entering a 6-digit PIN displayed on the TV screen.

For testing, you can use two iOS devices (or simulators) on the same network.
```
