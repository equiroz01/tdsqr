## Frequently Asked Questions

### Getting Started

#### How do I connect two devices?

1. Open TDS QR on your TV/display device and select **TV Mode**
2. Open TDS QR on your phone and select **Control Mode**
3. Either scan the QR code shown on the TV, or tap "Enter PIN manually" and enter the 6-digit PIN
4. Once connected, you can start adding content!

#### Do both devices need to be on the same WiFi?

Yes, both devices must be connected to the same WiFi network. TDS QR uses local network communication, which requires devices to be on the same network.

#### Do I need an internet connection?

No! TDS QR works entirely over your local network. Once the app is installed, no internet connection is required.

#### Do I need to create an account?

No account is needed. TDS QR works immediately after installation with no sign-up required.

3. **Check PIN:** Make sure you're entering the correct 6-digit PIN
