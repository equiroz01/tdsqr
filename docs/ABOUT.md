## How It Works

TDS QR uses an innovative two-device system:

### TV / Display Mode
Install TDS QR on the device connected to your screen (Apple TV, iPad, iPhone, or any iOS device). This device becomes your display, showing content in beautiful fullscreen presentations.

### Control Mode
Your iPhone becomes the remote control. Create QR codes, upload images, arrange your content, and manage everything wirelessly. Changes appear instantly on your display.

### Seamless Connection
Both devices connect securely over your local WiFi network. Simply scan a QR code or enter a 6-digit PIN to pair them together. No internet required, no accounts needed.
