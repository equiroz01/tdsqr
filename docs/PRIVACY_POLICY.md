## Introduction

TDS QR ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.

**Our core principle: Your data stays on your devices. We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal information to any external servers.**

## How the App Works

### Local Data Storage

All data you create within TDS QR is stored locally on your device:

- QR codes you create (names and URLs)
- Images you select for display
- App settings and preferences
- Language preferences

This data remains on your device and is never uploaded to external servers.

### Local Network Communication

TDS QR enables communication between two devices on the same WiFi network:

- **TV Mode Device:** Receives content to display
- **Control Mode Device:** Sends content to the TV

This communication occurs exclusively over your local network. Data transferred includes:
- QR code information (names and URLs)
- Selected images
- Presentation control commands (play, pause, next, previous)

**No data is transmitted over the internet or to third-party servers.**

## Device Permissions

TDS QR requests camera access for one purpose only:
- To scan QR codes for device pairing

Camera data is:
- Processed locally on your device

You can deny camera access and use manual PIN entry instead.

### Photo Library Access

TDS QR requests photo library access to:

- Never uploaded to external servers

### Local Network Access

TDS QR requires local network access to:
- Discover and connect to other TDS QR devices
- Transfer content between paired devices

This permission is essential for the app's core functionality.

---

## Data Security

### Encryption

- Device pairing uses a secure 6-digit PIN verification
- Local network communication uses standard protocols
- No sensitive data is stored in plain text

### Data Retention
